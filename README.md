## Why we should use eslint ?

### Find Problems

ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

### Fix Automatically

Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms.

### Customize

Preprocess code, use custom parsers, and write your own rules that work alongside ESLint's built-in rules. You can customize ESLint to work exactly the way you need it for your project.

## Why we should use airbnd ?

Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.

A mostly reasonable approach to JavaScript

Airbnd created some rules to write js code. It works with eslint as a plugin.

## Why we should use prettier ?

Prettier format code.

## Why we should use husky ?

It will not allow to commit into the bitbucket or github with buggy code.

It will test the code with eslint.

Note: If you want to use #husky in your project you must have a #.git folder in your project directory. Without it husky will not work. It's work with git hooks.
